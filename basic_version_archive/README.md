This is my personal/professional site hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 📁 Structure

- `/assets/` – images, styles, and scripts

## 🛠 Editing
You can edit any `.html` file in a text editor or GitHub's web UI. Look for `<h1>`, `<p>`, or `<ul>` tags to update text.

## 🚀 Deploy
GitHub Pages auto-deploys from the `main` branch of this repository.
